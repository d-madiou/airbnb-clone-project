# airbnb-clone-project
The goal of this project is to give you practical experience in developing a simple booking and management system using AirBnB as a case study. A good booking system should have a simple but lovely UI/UX that allows users to perform basic functionalities.

# UI/UX Design Planning.
## Design Goals
The main goals for the UI/UX design of our booking system are:
- **Simplicity**: Ensure that the interface is easy to navigate for all users, regardless of their technical skills.
- **Clarity**: Provide clear information about properties and the booking process to avoid confusion.
- **Responsiveness**: Design the interface to work seamlessly on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Aesthetics**: Create a visually appealing design that enhances the user experience and reflects the brand identity.

## Key Features
The key features that need to be implemented in the booking system include:
- User authentication (sign up and login)
- Property search and filtering options
- Property listing with images and descriptions
- Detailed view of each property with booking options
- Simple and secure checkout process
- User reviews and ratings for properties
- User profile management
